/**
 * The rendered size of each card, measured by the browser, for a layout to use.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. A card's height depends on what it holds (a unit stacks its
 * seats), its spacing scales with the density setting, and its text follows
 * the reader's own browser font size. A layout fed sizes copied into
 * TypeScript as constants would overlap cards in compact or comfortable
 * density and at any font size but the one somebody tested. So the cards are
 * rendered at their real width (a token), measured, and the measured sizes are
 * what the layout runs on.
 *
 * THE RULES IT KEEPS.
 *
 * - ONE ResizeObserver for every card, not one per card: a chart of a few
 *   hundred cards should cost one observer and one batched update per frame.
 * - A SIZE CHANGE IS APPLIED BEFORE PAINT. The observer reports after layout
 *   and before paint, and the update is flushed synchronously there, so a card
 *   that grows (a font finished loading, density changed, an operation added a
 *   seat) is never painted overlapping its neighbour for a frame.
 * - SUB-PIXEL NOISE IS NOT A CHANGE. Fractional re-measurements under half a
 *   pixel do not trigger a relayout, which would otherwise jitter a chart
 *   whose text renders at fractional sizes.
 * - NOTHING IS LAID OUT BEFORE IT IS MEASURED. `measured(ids)` says whether
 *   every card a layout needs has a size yet; until it does the caller shows
 *   nothing and fits nothing.
 * - THE ACTED ON NODE STAYS PUT. `useLayoutAnchor` moves the view before paint
 *   so the node the operator just touched keeps its screen position when a
 *   relayout moves it in the world.
 *
 * Sizes are border box, unscaled by any transform: a card inside a zoomed
 * canvas reports the size it is laid out at, which is the size a layout needs.
 * The observer WATCHES the border box too, not the default content box:
 * density scales a card's padding, and a change to padding alone moves the
 * border box without touching the content box, so an observer left on the
 * default would never report it and the cards would overlap. A size is kept
 * after its card unmounts, so a card that returns (an undo) is placed at its
 * last size until the observer reports it again.
